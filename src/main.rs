// Dev: Zach Baird
// Purpose:
//  Break out basics of the Rust programming language
//   into different files under `src` to start learning
//   the language.
//  Individual notes on each section will reside in their
//   respective files.
//  Each module has a `run()` function. Reference the module
//   and ensure it has the `run()` function to see what's printed
//   while looking at the code.

fn main() {
    structs::run();
